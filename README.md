# Detecting-Spam-in-Amazon-Reviews-with-MinHash-LSH


This project identifies duplicate or spammy product reviews using MinHash and Locality Sensitive Hashing.

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used
- Python, NumPy, Dask
- Jupyter Notebook
- Amazon 2023 Reviews Dataset

## ðŸš€ How to Run
Clone the repo and open the Jupyter notebook. It will automatically download and process the data.

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Concepts
- Shingling
- Jaccard Similarity
- MinHash
- Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)

## Results
I was able to find multiple reviews and determine they were highly suspicious. 
Example: Multiple reviews from the same user, with a range of 60-100% Jaccard similarity, all on different products.
True examples are included in the bottom of the jupyter notebook
